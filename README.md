#Twitch Moderation Bot

Simple moderation bot for Twitch.tv channels. Still early days, so not a lot of features yet, and probably a lot of bugs. Code is also messy, and not documented yet.
Some of the features so far:

* Simple spam protection, including ascii, emotes, all caps and urls.
* Follow Age, check how long someone has been following the channel.
* Custom commands
* Custom ban phrases

Features have configurable access levels, X are immune to spam protection, or only X or up can use features. Current levels are broadcaster, moderators, subscribers or everyone.
