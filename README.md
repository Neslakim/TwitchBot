<h1>Twitch Moderation Bot</h1>

Simple moderation bot for Twitch.tv channels. Still early days, so not a lot of features yet, and probably a lot of bugs. Code is also messy, and not documented yet.
<br/><br/>
Some of the features so far:
<ul>
<li>Simple spam protection, including ascii, emotes, all caps and urls.</li>
<li>Follow Age, check how long someone has been following the channel.</li>
<li>Custom commands</li>
<li>Custom ban phrases</li>
</ul>

Features have configurable access levels, X are immune to spam protection, or only X or up can use features. Current levels are broadcaster, moderators, subscribers or everyone.
